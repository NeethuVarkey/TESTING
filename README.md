# TESTING

This was an Interview Question I got from Yum.com. The API's were provided by them

In this take home exercise, you will test that a
cart API is able to return a total price for two products
in the cart.

On a high-level, you'll do this by:

- Fetching a menu.
- Creating a new cart.
- Adding two products to the cart.
- Verifying the total price in the cart is correct.
